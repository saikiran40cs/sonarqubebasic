# Install SonarQube on your machine and run as a service {#install-sonarqube-and-run-as-a-service}

In the last section by running SonarQube in command line we have proven that all required configuration, frameworks and permissions are correct. In this section we’ll install **SonarQube as a windows service.**

If you want to change the default URL of SonarQube then update the following in _**sonar.properties under configuration folder\(conf\)of sonarQube**_ installation.

```
sonar.web.host=0.0.0.0

# Web context. When set, it must start with forward slash (for example /sonarqube).
# The default value is root context (empty value).
sonar.web.context=/
# TCP port for incoming HTTP connections. Default value is 9000.
sonar.web.port=<to the port number you want to change>
```

Open up a command line as an **administrator **and navigate to the folder _C:\SonarQube\sonarqube-6.3.1\bin\windows-x86-64_. Invoke _InstallNTService.bat_. This will install SonarQube as a service.

In run prompt type `services.msc` and search for SonarQube service. Change the service logon user account to the desired account \(In my case it is SonarUser\). Start the service and refresh the services console after a few seconds to ensure that the service hasn’t failed. If the service has failed to start look in the log file to see the reason for the failure.

Now open up an instance of the browser and navigate to **localhost:9000** to see the SonarQube website being returned from the process running as a windows service.

You can log in to the SonarQube website by using the default account _admin/admin_.

> If you have run into some issues, I recommend you to view the Logs section in the SonarQube installation directory. At enterprise level installation it is recommended to be performed by the installation team.
