**About the Software:**

---

**SonarQubeÂ® **platform is an open source quality management platform, dedicated to continuously analyzing and measuring the technical quality of source code, from project portfolio down to the method level, and tracking the introduction of new Bugs, Vulnerabilities, and Code Smells in the Leak Period.

SonarQube can perform analysis on 20+ different languages. The outcome of this analysis will be quality measures and issues \(instances where coding rules were broken\). However, what gets analyzed will vary depending on the language:

* On all languages, "blame" data will automatically be imported from supported SCM providers. Git and SVN are supported automatically. Other providers require [additional plugins](http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/PLUG/Plugin+Library).
* On all languages, a static analysis of source code is performed \(Java files, COBOL programs, etc.\)
* A static analysis of compiled code can be performed for certain languages \(_.class_ files in Java, _.dll_ files in C\#, etc.\)
* A dynamic analysis of code can be performed on certain languages.

## **Unrecognized files** {#unrecognized-files}

By default, only files that are recognized by a language plugin are loaded into the project during analysis. For example if your SonarQube instance has the Java and JavaScript plugins on board, all .java and .js files will be loaded, but .xml files will be ignored. However, it is possible to import all text files in the analysis encoding in a project by setting **Settings &gt; Exclusions &gt; Files &gt;** Import unknown files to true.

## **During Analysis** {#during-analysis}

During analysis, data is requested from the server, the files provided to the analysis are analyzed, and the resulting data is sent back to the server at the end in the form of a report, which is then analyzed asynchronously server-side.

Analysis reports are queued, and processed sequentially, so it is quite possible that for a brief period after your analysis log shows completion, the updated values are not visible in your SonarQube project. However, you will be able to tell what's going on because an icon will be added next to the project name.
